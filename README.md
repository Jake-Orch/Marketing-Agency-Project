# Marketing Agency Project
In this project i have been tasked with reviewing the HTML and CSS code for "Horiseon" (a marketing company) and improving the code in many ways to make it function better and to improve its readability. I did this in many ways (all changes are noted in the code its-self) such as; making sure the HTML code follows a logical structure, condensing css elements, adding alt attributes to images and adding a title to the webpage.
